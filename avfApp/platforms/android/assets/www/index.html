                            <li>Using live data often can be an inconvenience for users because many of the resources may require them to create an account, which they will have to log into. However, nowadays, social networking sites such as Twitter allow users to use their social network account as a means to login to other outside resources. This can save users loads of time and also save them the hassle of having to create multiple accounts, by giving them the option to use just their social networking account’s credentials to log in to other sites. Payments are easier than ever now thanks to a collaboration between Twitter and American Express that allows users to pay for items using a hashtag. After signing up for this, a user can use their Twitter account to buy a product simply by posting a tweet with a specific hashtag. Similar to logging in, this also can save users time and frustration by allowing them to use their single social networking account to purchase items.</li>
                        
                            <li>The difference between JSON and JSON-P is that JSON-P allows developers to pull data from outside sources that are completely separate from the website the user is viewing. When developing our apps, it will be really important for us to be able to use JSON-P so that we can pull data from outside API’s, such as Instagram, and any other API that we would like to pull from. For my app I want to be able to pull in weather information, so using JSON-P will make it much easier for me to access that data from outside sources and pull it into my app.</li>
                        
                        <li>There are many data resources that will work well with native device features. Some examples are:
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>Family Search - This resource allows users to do a genealogical search to obtain information about their family members and to create a family tree. This would work well if it could work with a device’s contacts that are stored, giving the user the ability to search information about a relative or start creating their family tree from specific family members that are already stored in their contacts.
                                </li>
                        
                                <li>Face.com - This API resource has the ability to detect, recognize and tag faces in a photo. This would definitely pair well with the device’s camera and photos. By connecting these a user could access their saved photos and detect who is in each photo with ease.
                                </li>
                        
                                <li>Foursquare - This API allows us to access all of the locations stored within Foursquare’s database, as well as check-in information. This would pair well with a device’s geolocation and contacts. Combining these within an app would be a handy way for a developer to create a new app that has the capability to be able to see where one’s friends may have visited and what places are around them. For example, in my beach app that I mention below, I could use Foursquare’s API to allow my users to see what beaches their friends have visited.
                                </li>
                                </ul>
                        </li>
                        
                                <li>I live in Florida, and one of my favorite things to do is go to the beach. However, the weather in Florida can vary drastically from one location to another, even when nearby each other. For example, it could be storming at one beach, but a few miles down the road could be sunny with blue skies as storms pass through the area so quickly. For my app I was thinking of designing a beach app that could let a user know which beaches are around them using the phone’s geolocation feature, and then using a weather API they could see what the current weather is like at each beach around them. This would allow them to plan a beach trip with their friends hopefully without getting rained out. Also, this could tie into Instagram by allowing them to view current pictures that people are taking at each of those beaches based on hashtags.
                                </li>
                                
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>An important lesson that I’ve learned is that sometimes I have to force myself to take a break and walk away. Coding can be extremely frustrating at times when you can’t get things to work right, and sometimes the only way to fix my mistakes is to get up and give my brain a rest from looking at the code. I tend to get so into it that I can’t stop myself until I figure out what’s wrong, but sometimes that ends up wasting more time. For example, in our last class, I had an issue where my app was not working at all, and I spent about 5 hours straight trying to figure out what was wrong before I finally gave up for the night. The next day when I went back to it, I figured out the problem and fixed it within 10 minutes. If I had taken a break the night before and walked away, I probably could’ve fixed it much sooner instead of wasting a whole night trying to solve 1 problem.</li>
