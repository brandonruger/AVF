                        <ol data-role="listview">
                            <li>Using live data often can be an inconvenience for users because many of the resources may require them to create an account, which they will have to log into. However, nowadays, social networking sites such as Twitter allow users to use their social network account as a means to login to other outside resources. This can save users loads of time and also save them the hassle of having to create multiple accounts, by giving them the option to use just their social networking account’s credentials to log in to other sites. Payments are easier than ever now thanks to a collaboration between Twitter and American Express that allows users to pay for items using a hashtag. After signing up for this, a user can use their Twitter account to buy a product simply by posting a tweet with a specific hashtag. Similar to logging in, this also can save users time and frustration by allowing them to use their single social networking account to purchase items.</li>
                            <li>The difference between JSON and JSON-P is that JSON-P allows developers to pull data from outside sources that are completely separate from the website the user is viewing. When developing our apps, it will be really important for us to be able to use JSON-P so that we can pull data from outside API’s, such as Instagram, and any other API that we would like to pull from. For my app I want to be able to pull in weather information, so using JSON-P will make it much easier for me to access that data from outside sources and pull it into my app.</li>
                            <li>There are many data resources that will work well with native device features. Some examples are: Family Search - This resource allows users to do a genealogical search to obtain information about their family members and to create a family tree. This would work well if it could work with a device’s contacts that are stored, giving the user the ability to search information about a relative or start creating their family tree from specific family members that are already stored in their contacts. Face.com - This API resource has the ability to detect, recognize and tag faces in a photo. This would definitely pair well with the device’s camera and photos. By connecting these a user could access their saved photos and detect who is in each photo with ease. Foursquare - This API allows us to access all of the locations stored within Foursquare’s database, as well as check-in information. This would pair well with a device’s geolocation and contacts. Combining these within an app would be a handy way for a developer to create a new app that has the capability to be able to see where one’s friends may have visited and what places are around them. For example, in my beach app that I mention below, I could use Foursquare’s API to allow my users to see what beaches their friends have visited.</li>
                            <li>I live in Florida, and one of my favorite things to do is go to the beach. However, the weather in Florida can vary drastically from one location to another, even when nearby each other. For example, it could be storming at one beach, but a few miles down the road could be sunny with blue skies as storms pass through the area so quickly. For my app I was thinking of designing a beach app that could let a user know which beaches are around them using the phone’s geolocation feature, and then using a weather API they could see what the current weather is like at each beach around them. This would allow them to plan a beach trip with their friends hopefully without getting rained out. Also, this could tie into Instagram by allowing them to view current pictures that people are taking at each of those beaches based on hashtags.</li>
                            <li>An important lesson that I’ve learned is that sometimes I have to force myself to take a break and walk away. Coding can be extremely frustrating at times when you can’t get things to work right, and sometimes the only way to fix my mistakes is to get up and give my brain a rest from looking at the code. I tend to get so into it that I can’t stop myself until I figure out what’s wrong, but sometimes that ends up wasting more time. For example, in our last class, I had an issue where my app was not working at all, and I spent about 5 hours straight trying to figure out what was wrong before I finally gave up for the night. The next day when I went back to it, I figured out the problem and fixed it within 10 minutes. If I had taken a break the night before and walked away, I probably could’ve fixed it much sooner instead of wasting a whole night trying to solve 1 problem.</li>

                        <ol data-role="listview">
                            <li>I think I’ve done a pretty good job labeling all the elements in my HTML according to semantic guidelines, so I think my app would be good for accessibility purposes. All of my pages are organized within sections, and include headings and unordered lists with list tags, which would all be helpful for a screen reader to read the contents on my app. Also all of my anchor links are clearly labeled with text appropriate for a screen reader.</li>
                            <li>One of the biggest frustrations that I found with some of the more advanced screen readers is the cost. Screen readers similar to Jaws can cost thousands of dollars, which a lot of people do not have. They also seem to be very confusing for those who are not very tech savvy, as they involve a lot of different keystroke combinations that may be hard to remember, plus a lot of guessing. Lastly, the information contained on most websites tends to be extremely cluttered to visually impaired individuals, which requires them to go through a lot of unimportant information to get to the parts they need to access. There are some free screen readers available that seem to be improving, so we could help promote those more to users who cannot afford a program like Jaws. The best way to improve the other issues would be to ensure that my code for websites and apps that I develop is as efficient as possible. This can be done by ensuring elements are labeled semantically with the best possible html tags, and ensuring the text that is between those tags is clear and easy to search for. For example, links need to be labeled appropriately. Instead of labeling a link as “downloadable mp3’s”, it would make more sense just to call it “music” since that is what people will search for when scrolling through the page. This will save visually impaired users the hassle of having to listen to the entire of page just to find one link that could’ve easily been searched for.</li>
                            <li>One device that has been made to support Accessibility is the Kindle Fire made by Amazon. This device has a number of features available to support users that are both visually and/or hearing impaired. The Kindle Fire comes with a built in screen reader that can provide spoken feedback to users as well as turn regular e-books into audiobooks. Another feature for visually impaired users is that the Kindle allows users to explore the device using accessibility gestures by touch to quickly return home, go back, as well as access many other key features. It also includes braille support  with a free app that’s available in the app store, and closed captioning on videos for hearing impaired users. Another device made to support Accessibility is a new series of television models released by Panasonic in 2012 in the United Kingdom. These television models are an innovative design that is meant to enhance the experience for visually impaired viewers. Key features of this product include voice guidance where the TV uses text-to-speech to read aloud onscreen information. The viewer can then communicate back to the television to control the TV. The text-to-speech feature can speak a lot of information including channel name, program information, the onscreen program guide, etc.</li>
                            <li>One mobile app designed to support Accessibility is Sendero GPS LookAround. This app gives iOS users who are visually impaired the ability to use their phone to see what’s around them. The app uses GPS as well as iOS’s Voice Over feature to communicate with the user by telling them what is around them. It can tell them the current street they are on, the cross street, the city they are in, etc. Another app made to support Accessibility is called Earl and is available in the app store. Earl was also made specifically for users who are blind or visually impaired. Earl works by allowing users to listen to content such as magazine articles, newspapers, as well as content on mobile websites and e-books. They can also make commands by using their voice. Another great feature of Earl is that they can use it free for a maximum of 15 minutes per day. If they wish to listen to more content then they will need to purchase a subscription.</li>

                        <h3>Week 3 Research</h3>
                         <ol data-role="listview">
                            <li>In all 3 nations, it is evident that gaming apps top the lists across the charts for the top selling apps. Not only are gaming apps the most popular, but they also are the most profitable for developers. According to statistics posted on mobithinking.com, 33% of all apps that are downloaded are game related apps, followed by widgets which account for 8% of apps downloaded, and then entertainment related apps averaging 7% of apps used. In terms of revenue earned from these and other apps, the US tops the list of countries for apps earning revenue. After the US, Japan comes in at 2nd, followed by South Korea and then the United Kingdom.</li>
                            <li>Gaming is popular all over the world, and seems to be one of people’s favorite things to do on their mobile devices. This also means that it’s probably one of the most competitive areas for app developers, as trying to create a game that will hold people’s interest can be tough. In 2012, out of the 1.2 billion app users in the world, only 18% of them came from North America, while 29% came from Europe, and 30% from Asia. Since these other users have a higher percentage of app users compared to the US, but the US earns the highest revenue for apps, it means that the majority of those countries’ users probably tend to choose free apps over paid apps. This means that in order to make money off of a game app in these countries, us developers need to make sure that it meets the meets and desires of our users so they will be willing to spend money either to purchase the app, or for in-app upgrades.</li>
                            <li>When taking into consideration the cost of mobile data across the world, it is evident that in most developed countries, the cost of mobile data tends to be lower. In underdeveloped countries, the users usually end up paying much more for their data packages. However, this is not the case in the United States. The US and Japan are two of the most expensive countries for mobile data plans. According to economist.com, if you were to consider the cost of 500 megabytes of data per month for prepaid data plans, on average it would cost about $85 in the United States, while only costing $8.80 in Great Britain. This is a drastic difference in price! They did not offer any specific data as to the pricing for data in Japan, but according to other sources, Japan’s data rates are pretty similar to those of the United States. In the past, most cell phone companies did not impose restrictions on bandwidth limits. Instead, they did what’s known as toggling, meaning that if a user met their bandwidth limit for the month, then they would toggle their download speeds making them slower for the remainder of their monthly cycle. However, this has since changed, and now most cell phone carriers across all 3 of these locations are restricting the amount of data a user is allowed to use in a month’s time. Anything over that amount will require them to pay additional data fees. T-Mobile is one of the only US providers left that does not charge steep overage fees to its users.</li>
                            <li>It’s clear that gaming is extremely popular amongst mobile users, so my project topic of choice would to be able to invest my time and energy into developing an awesome game that could be played all over the world. My primary targets would be the US and Japan, since they top the charts as the countries that earn the highest revenue for mobile apps. According to Stat Counter’s website, iOS is still leading as the #1 most widely used mobile operating system across the US, Great Britain, and Japan, followed by Android at #2. This means that when developing these gaming apps, it will be extremely important to make sure it runs on both iOS and Android.</li>
